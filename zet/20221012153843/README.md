# confluent.io

- scam artists who offer databases and software as a service at https://www.confluent.io/
- literally the worst way to store or analyze data, by cost, by a factor of hundreds.
  - Confluent cannot store even a modest 300 gigabytes of data for less than thousands of dollars per month
  - they will attempt to upcharge you on partitions or some other ridiculous scheme.
  - check the billing page every day.
  - encourage lower cost or self hosted alternatives.
- provides kafka databases, which you can host yourself
  - how to host kafka databases yourself with proper authentication? - make a card
- developed ksql, which can be useful for time window analysis. for all other purposes, use awk.
- use their ksql server docker or connectors for free and do not pay them.
- stack: most likely scala + akka
