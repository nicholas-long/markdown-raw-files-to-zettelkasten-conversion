# side panels work in vim with tmux over ssh now?

- didn't work
  - big documents
  - sketchy vim / nvim update and redraw issues with side by side splits
    - only over ssh (remember testing nvim and vim)
  - would use vertical splits all the time instead
  - usually ran it in tmux
- seems to work now?
