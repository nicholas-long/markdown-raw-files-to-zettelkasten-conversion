# Credit where credit is due

- this got imported by default from a rule file rules
  - the one named "one rule to rule them all" - ?
- pretty cool, could try importing other random markdown
  - did not realize the markdown conversion process itself could be useful for importing
    - hierarchical data -> starter graph

original title:
# Credit where credit is due

The rule file is a combination of rules from various sources

1. https://github.com/praetorian-inc/Hob0Rules (d3adhob0.rule, hob064.rule)
2. http://contest-2010.korelogic.com/rules-hashcat.html (KoreLogicRulesPrependRockYou50000)
3. https://github.com/NSAKEY/nsa-rules (_NSAKEY.v2.dive.rule)
4. https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/ oclHashcat v1.20 (by https://github.com/evilmog) (generated2.rule)

If we have missed adding someone in credit, feel free to send a note or open a github issue and we will sort it out.
