# asciinema website for recording terminal session

- record terminal sessions
- install with pip
- interesting authentication mechanisms - seem like pretty good practices?
  - login with email confirmation
  - no passwords
    - authentication done each time by accessing a GUID resource and associating you using session cookies or tokens
      - effectively email 2fa
      - why bother with reset links
      - not critical enough for serious 2fa? users hate 2fa
    - authentication done same way in terminal - GUID link that gives you access to upload to the account

```
sudo pip3 install asciinema
```
