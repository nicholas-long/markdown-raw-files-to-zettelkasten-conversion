# cyberpunk retro machine project Tandy TRS-80 Model 100 terminal hacks
- using ex as an editor
  - need significant hacks to remove color from `ex`.
  - need to change CRLF sent from model 100 to get it to work
- using ed as editor
  - not possible to pipe lines into commands?
- bash
  - disable colors everywhere in all bash aliases
  - bash prompt still has some weird escape characters
