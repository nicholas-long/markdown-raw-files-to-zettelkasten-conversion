# GraphQL APIs how GraphQL works
- implements graph structure in database
- reading and modifying, code written ahead of time
  - queries fetch data
  - mutations edit
  - fragments are lists of fields
  - metafields for inspection of query or mutation
- fragments are like classes of data with defined fields
  - a list of things to select that can be reused for different objects
