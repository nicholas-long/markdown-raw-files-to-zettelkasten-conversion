- new links are currently spawning at the top
- irritating to re-sort them
- the ordering carries meaning and ease for traversing cards, so sorting is important, and having new cards in your face is not great.
- commit 4f1fe848fdb3634e0064c3cb3af1737b39094ea7
  - proper link formatting and links appear at bottom
