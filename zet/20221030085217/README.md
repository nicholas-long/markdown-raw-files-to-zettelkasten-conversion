# rwxrob KEG book composition video 10-28

- added today: https://github.com/rwxrob/keg-spec
- 0:34:00 - testing yaml front matter
- 2:45:00 starts talking with chat
- frontmatter is a disaster
  - "never mix data and doc..."
- how does this relate to my idea embedding yaml with `property:: value` syntax and scraping that into yaml files?
- "tom made jekyll in like a week... world standard for exchanging knowledge"
- rob hates obsidian
  - i understand the sentiment - it was good for taking notes hacking boxes, but then none of the images or links worked on github or anywhere else.
  - the graph view is a dope feature to use to explore zet, but i cannot use it as the primary editor for a zettelkasten because of the compatibility issues with other platforms.
