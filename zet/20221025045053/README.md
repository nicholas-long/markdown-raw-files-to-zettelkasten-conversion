# yaml data convention for my zet implementation

- put yaml data in file in zettelkasten card directory for querying
  - not `data.yaml` because that is a reserved file for rwxrob KEG which i think is supposed to have the actual zettelkasten data in it
- convention from dataview: `property:: value` in card text will populate data to yaml data file
  - not in snippet
- using yq program as dependency
  - include binaries here
  - TODO: add shell script to select platform binary
    - there's no other reason this stuff can't go to ARM?

```
