# implement a graph query language

- would allow for quickly and easily scripting some stuff up in cards
- search by tags and connections
  - ex: `for all #developer; #developer -> #inbox; yield #inbox` return card IDs of multiple inboxes
  - looks better `#developer -> #inbox`
    - return the last thing automatically?
- shouldn't be too hard
- like relational database from old awk book
- look at graphql for inspiration?
- look at neo4j for inspiration?
