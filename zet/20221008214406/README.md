# sharing programming projects with zettelkasten

starting new node for idea of sharing hiveminds or knowledge bases between programmers

- quick overview
    - "card" = a directory in zet
        - has permanent IDs and links to other permanent IDs
        - everything is a file (directory)
    - my implementation:
        - Related header - everything below is it should be considered touched altered by scripts
        - could use embedded yml file if necessary? - link
        - based on rwxrob zet repo at - link
            - research rwxrob tips
- documentation, references, and code are connected through cards
    - if a zettel / card has scripts that interact with one another, link documentation together
    - make a link one way by
        - removing it from related
        - putting human readable link in content
        - `viunlink`
- create issues for things to fix and link to a new zettel for research and notes about it

```
