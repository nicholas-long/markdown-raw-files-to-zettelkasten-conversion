# clone a subsection of a graph by tag boundaries

- concept of `clone a subsection of a graph by tag boundaries`
- for example
  - start at a template node
  - grab all neighboring nodes recursively that have `#template` tag
  - clone them, updating all IDs to match
- would be really useful for OSCP AD network to be able to have multiple machine notes that could all be linked together somehow
