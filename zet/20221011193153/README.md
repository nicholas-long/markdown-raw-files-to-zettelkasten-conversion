  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUltI4v_UU4&t=0s - previous video
  - "focusing bias" - paying attention to fixing one aspect of problems ?

    - it looks like it's actually important
    - should add titles

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUltI4v_UU4&t=0s

  - obsidian
  - graph view
  - evergreen notes
    - evergren note - return and imporve it over time
  - chrome extension youtube addon `yinote`
    - timestamps from videos
    - good for literature notes
    - alternative to "rocketnote", which costs like $30
    - can link to google docs
    - looks like it can link to github ?
    - relating to my implementation: could automatically pull in video links and timestamps into a card instead of making video notes cards ?
  - system is good for ADHD?
    - obsessed with improving workflow
    - "well defined tasks negate the need for the use of a limited supply of willpower"
  - human nature says we look for confirmation bias, things that fit/agree with our exising premises
  - concepts from andy mattieschaek's/mataczyk [SP] evergreen notes
    - distilling idea to simplest component so it is a note in itslef
    - link heavily to note
    - atomic
    - evergren note - return and imporve it over time
  - talks about running bash scripts on notes
  - "command click" notes - open up side panels, scroll through them like note cards on a desk
  - drawback to digital:
    - back with paper notes, you only wrote down what you actually cared about retaining
      - prioritizing / sorting on the spot
      - with copy paste, you can pull in too much
        - only save what you care about?
  - step-by-step system
    - incoming content
    - idea distillation
    - produced output
  - workflow flowcharts
  - plant analogies for ideas: seedlings
    - seeds of ideas
    - incubator = WIP
    - plant seed into "evergreen forest"
  - "bip tag"
    - yaml in document?
