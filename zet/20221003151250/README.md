# sending installs to target

- cool project to come up with ideas for how to send a whole functioning install of complicated binary programs like hacking enumeration tools to CTF boxes, which often have no external internet access, and are therefore unable to install new programs from package managers.
- install programs on target as tar archive file using docker to find installed dependencies
- [20221003151248](/zet/20221003151248/README.md) install pip modules on target as files with no dependencies on network connection to pip
