# why does kali apt break bat?

- bat is available from its github
- i should be able to install it with apt but i cannot
  - i install the deb file manually
  - when updates come out, apt "updates" it again with more bad packages and removes my command, have to go fix
    - irritating
- i can't have sketchy issues with tools my bash scripts are using

```
