screen and tmux

- i used screen in tandy model 100 project
  - because it still has support for various serial tty terminal features and things that history probably forgot about
- interesting historical context
- save hotkey `ctrl+a`
- anecdote about why it's important, long running processes and remote connections dying
- run screen or tmux for long-running processes
  - i know this but it's important enough to be worth remembering these options are available
- screen shares keyboard just like tmux
- talking about "issues with memory corruption" at 15:45
  - is he talking about screen 4.5.0 local privilege escalation - https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41154
    - WOW i cannot believe i remembered that off the top of my head
- why @ 17:00
- use ctrl-A for hotkey because of muscle memory from using screen
  - i do need a new hotkey unfortunately since ctrl space is often not possible to do on a lot of devices
  - testing: if you change this, you have to fix
    - ctrl a apt repo hotkey
    - ...?
  - ctrl a is way more responsive
    - i bet ctrl space is not intended to be sent as an escape code normally and is unsupported most places except fancy terminal emulators
- no arrow keys (ofc)
