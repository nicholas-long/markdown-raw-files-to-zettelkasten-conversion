# linux privilege escalation
- `sudo -l`
  - specific permissions to binaries / scripts
    - writable
    - [exploiting scripts on linux](linux.md#exploiting-scripts-on-linux)
  - vulnerable versions of allowed commands
  - `LD_PRELOAD`
  - broken -> SSH / valid TTY and retry
- SUID binaries
  - gtfobins
  - vulnerable versions
  - distinguish default binaries from custom https://github.com/Anon-Exploiter/SUID3NUM
- /opt
- custom interesting binaries or scripts running as other users or root
  - everything from [got source code - analysis](../got-source-code.md#got-source-code---analysis)
  - dependent binaries
- linpeas ( allowed on OSCP if no automatic exploitation )
- getcap capabilities
- enumerate all readable files
- writable files
  - find /etc -writable 2>/dev/null
  - user
  - group
- check mounts in /etc/fstab
- sensitive config files
  - htpasswd
  - database configs
- sensitive logs
  - auth.log
  - bash history
    - passwords or secrets in commands
  - may contain accidental passwords in usernames in login failures
  - dmesg command
- su or brute force with common credentials i.e. `root:root`
- OS version `uname -a && cat /etc/*-release` -> exploit db
- docker
  - from host
    - scan port range to identify running services
      - ssh -> reuse keys and creds found on host
      - exploit known services
  - inside docker
    - check mounted directories
      - write suid binaries to be executed on host
    - deepce
  - image repository -> pull image, hunt for secrets
- root processes, especially
  - databases
  - services exposed on local ports
- installed packages `dpkg -l`
- find scripts, crons, timers
  - pspy
  - exploit wildcards in scripts or cron jobs
  - cron jobs
    - writable scripts
    - writable things used by script
  - [exploiting linux scripts](#exploiting linux scripts)
  - writable or exploitable timers
  - executable payloads or includes -> chmod 777
- local ports
- git or other repositories - check history
- enumerate all writable files and directories
- restricted shell?
  - attempt to execute command on ssh login with argument
  - restricted bash breakouts
  - python script shell breakouts
- writable PATH ( not just my user's path )
- writable service
  - directories `systemctl show-environment`
- headline exploits from privesc to try list
- linux exploit suggester or `les2.pl`
- linenum
- search files by modification date with `find` to see what creators added
- directory permissions that let you move files you can't access
- processes with readable memory
- access to mount - mount something containing setuid binaries
- su or hydra ssh test credential reuse
- check exploits / vulnerabilities found during enumeration
  - leaked credentials
  - potential privesc exploits
  - vulnerable services running as root
- java web -> find website code packaged into war file
  - secrets, config, hardcoded creds
- meterpreter local suggester ( could use once on OSCP )
- no access to read webroot -> try appending known filenames to path to read
- fail2ban -> default config `iptables-multiport.conf` `actionban`
- centos / redhat -> check special file access permissions getfacl
- read / write files as root -> [got read or write access to filesystem](hacking/to-try-lists/got-read-or-write-access-to-filesystem.md#got-read-or-write-access-to-filesystem)
- generate password list for each/all users and sucrack
