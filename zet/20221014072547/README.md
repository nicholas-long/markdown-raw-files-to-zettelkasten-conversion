# ideas need to be explained and connected to relevant things

- writing down and connecting ideas quickly means they can be cataloged for later processing somewhere else
- from our perspective, we won't forget things
    - i swear writing down notes reduces anxiety, and my partner does too, except hers are only on paper.
- from the perspective of memes and information, the information has been safely copied and cataloged
    - if information has "evolved" to a point that it "wants to survive" and is "scared" of being forgotten, then it follows that it is trying to get saved somewhere
    - will be connected to various other topics where it can be noticed

    ```
    Memes, analogously to genes, vary in their aptitude to replicate; successful memes remain and spread, whereas unfit ones stall and are forgotten. Thus, memes that prove more effective at replicating and surviving are selected in the meme pool.
    Memes first need retention. The longer a meme stays in its hosts, the higher its chances of propagation are. When a host uses a meme, the meme's life is extended.[31] The reuse of the neural space hosting a certain meme's copy to host different memes is the greatest threat to that meme's copy.[32] A meme that increases the longevity of its hosts will generally survive longer. On the contrary, a meme that shortens the longevity of its hosts will tend to disappear faster. However, as hosts are mortal, retention is not sufficient to perpetuate a meme in the long term; memes also need transmission
