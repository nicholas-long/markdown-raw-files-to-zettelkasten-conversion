# my netbook

- basically a cyberdeck
  - usable touchscreen linux system
  - size of mini tablet screen with full intel/amd PC
    - could probably be built ARM instead but it came out before that trend
  - hardware `One Mix`
      - came with windows 10
      - windows 11 might be okay for it but 10 wasn't great
- problems
  - touchpad C mouse lol - terrible
    - microsoft folding mice fit in pocket - use that instead
      - i don't know about bluetooth, use the one with a dongle
  - keyboard kinda cramped
    - vim is actually the only way it's practical to type or edit anything
  - ubuntu does not remember that i want the screen rotated to normal computer mode
    - had that problem with kali too. fixed in x display settings by diagnosing xorg log?
- can i remap caps lock to esc?
