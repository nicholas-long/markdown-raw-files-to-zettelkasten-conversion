# my One Mix netbook

- One Mix 2S
- basically a cyberdeck
  - usable touchscreen linux system
  - size of mini tablet screen with full intel/amd PC
    - could probably be built ARM instead but it came out before that trend
  - hardware
    - came with windows 10
    - windows 11 might be okay for it but 10 wasn't great
  - touchscreen works in alacritty and some other terminal emulators
    - not for scrolling, for highlighting or selecting / clicking
  - similar to GPD pocket https://gpd.hk/gpdpocket

- setup steps and fixing issues
  - screen rotation: by default, ubuntu does not remember screen rotation - set to normal
    - [fix](/zet/20221015172248/README.md) by creating a file for a hardware sensor
  - standby and sleeping issues: set "screen blank" in power to Never - fixed!

- problems
  - only one usb
  - battery life
    - terrible for web browsing
    - hours and hours in just terminal doing light editing work
  - keyboard kinda cramped
    - vim is actually the only way it's practical to type or edit anything
  - touchpad C mouse lol - terrible
    - microsoft folding mice fit in pocket - use that instead
      - i don't know about bluetooth, use the one with a dongle
  - came with weird charging cable - doesn't like other cables?
    - looks like USB C but nothing else works with it
    - usbc port on laptop is just for power

- cyberdeck-related ideas and improvements
  - trackball that actually does mouse scroll
  - LORA receiver
  - serial converter
  - gps

- low power mode with esc key?
  - "Interestingly One Netbook didn’t bother putting a new shortcut on the keyboard for that feature — you press Fn+Esc to enable quiet mode, and the graphic on the Esc key is identical to the one the company used for the keyboard backlight control on the original One Mix"
