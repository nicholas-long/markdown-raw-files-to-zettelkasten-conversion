# my One Mix netbook

- basically a cyberdeck
  - usable touchscreen linux system
  - size of mini tablet screen with full intel/amd PC
    - could probably be built ARM instead but it came out before that trend
  - hardware
    - came with windows 10
    - windows 11 might be okay for it but 10 wasn't great
  - touchscreen works in alacritty and some other terminal emulators
    - not for scrolling, for highlighting or selecting / clicking
- problems
  - only one usb
  - battery life
    - terrible for web browsing
    - hours and hours in just terminal doing light editing work
  - ubuntu does not remember that i want the screen rotated to normal computer mode
    - had that problem with kali too. fixed in x display settings by diagnosing xorg log?
    - i think xorg and x11 are different?
    - [20221015172248](/zet/20221015172248/README.md) why does ubuntu gnome not remember the screen rotation?
  - standby and sleeping issues
    - can sleep with lid closed for hours and pop open instantly into vim
    - until it decides to suspend - i think?
    - after starting from suspend, screen is black and unresponsive
  - keyboard kinda cramped
    - vim is actually the only way it's practical to type or edit anything
  - touchpad C mouse lol - terrible
    - microsoft folding mice fit in pocket - use that instead
      - i don't know about bluetooth, use the one with a dongle
  - came with weird charging cable - doesn't like other cables?
    - looks like USB C but nothing else works with it
    - usbc port on laptop is just for power
- can i remap caps lock to esc?

```
