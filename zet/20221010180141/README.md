# reinforcement learning and motivation and candy rewards

the concept of `reinforcement learning and motivation and candy rewards`
- saw a guy with an IOT device that fed him candy for issues/pull requests or something - where was that?
- i use a similar idea after every time i do work around the house so that i don't hate it so much that i never want to do it again
  - why are sinks so short
