# how to get titles to show up in obsidian graph

- concept of `get graph titles working in obsidian`
- obsidian community plugin `front matter title` looks like it could be usable
  - https://github.com/Snezhig/obsidian-front-matter-title
  - intended for embedded yaml? works with titles.
  - set plugin setting "Template" to `#heading` - magic value that means to read the first heading instead of yaml
  - need to edit config in order to get it to reapply the settings and change the graph?
    - enable debug mode and all settings
    - introduces some additional lag into graph

```
