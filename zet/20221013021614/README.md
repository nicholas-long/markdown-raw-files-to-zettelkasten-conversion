# terminal graph browser

- concept of `terminal graph browser`
- is awesome
- fzf loop just like `zc`
  - preview window shows document always, menu picks options, option to visit links
- text user interface ( TUI ) to follow links like web browser
  - add and remove links quickly
  - navigate back - very useful
    - if you edit links in cards you are working on, you could get trapped and need to hop back to previous card
- TODO: edit a document and specific links in tabs from menu?
