# differences organizing zettelkasten in graph vs files in hierarchy

- notes in filesystem
  - have idea
  - figure out where to put it
    - folders = concepts?
    - files = collections?
    - what if a note is about 2 things?
  - stressful - sucks

- notes in zk graph
  - create idea
  - link it to as many relevant places as you can
  - gets elaborated on by having enriching links to neighbors
