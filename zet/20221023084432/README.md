# graph theory

- concept of `graph theory`
- graph = {verticies, edges}
- "node" = vertex
- order = number of verticies
- size = number of edges
- loop connects a vertex to itself
- graph types
  - complete - all nodes fully interconnected
  - empty - has 0 verticies
    - some definitions include a graph with 0 verticies
  - trivial graph - has 1 vertex with 0 edges, empty graph on 1 vertex
  - null graph - no verticies and no edges
- 2 edges are adjacent if they are connected to the same vertex "incident with the vertex"
- subgraph - graph that contains same verticies and edges
  - proper vs. improper - improper subgraph is exactly equal to the same graph
  - spanning subgraph
    - vertex set is equal
  - vertex-induced subgraph or just "induced subgraph"
    - verticies must be adjacent if they are adjacent in main graph
    - notation: include subset of verticies, all edges are implied to come with?
    - similar to copying zet directories and enriching
  - edge induced subgraph
    - all verticies must be incident with edges in the graph
    - notation: include subset of edges
    - has some edges
    - only verticies that are incident with those edges
  - notation of incident subgraphs - includes just a subset of edges or verticies; underlined variable with set in square brackets
