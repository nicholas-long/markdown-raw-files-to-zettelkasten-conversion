# graph theory

- concept of `graph theory`
- graph = {verticies, edges}
- "node" = vertex
- order = number of verticies
- size = number of edges
- loop connects a vertex to itself
- graph types
  - complete - all nodes fully interconnected
  - empty - has 0 verticies
    - some definitions include a graph with 0 verticies
  - trivial graph - has 1 vertex with 0 edges, empty graph on 1 vertex
  - null graph - no verticies and no edges
- 2 edges are adjacent if they are connected to the same vertex "incident with the vertex"
- subgraph - graph that contains same verticies and edges
  - proper vs. improper - improper subgraph is exactly equal to the same graph
  - spanning subgraph
    - vertex set is equal
