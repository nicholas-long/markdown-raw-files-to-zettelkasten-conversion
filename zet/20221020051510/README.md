# knowledge operations ideas

- concept of `knowledge operations ideas`
- join 2 concepts
  - example: taking notes on a machine
    - concepts
      - IP is a general concept
      - machine is a specific noun/concept
    - joining: a node connected to the machine and to the IP titled "machine XYZ's IP" ...?
    - silly toy example, don't need a card to store an IP
  - example: bash is a concept, a file is a concept, a shell script is a file for bash - joined concepts
- spawning
  - bringing a small subset of connections and sentences with - the relevant bits
  - cleaning out connections that are now very redundant in originating node
- if there is only one useless card in between two other cards, that is empty or has the same info, it can be dissolved. the connections can be brought over like unlinking a node from a linked list.
