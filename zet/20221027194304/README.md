# rwxrob terminal velocity video 10-27

- random idea: could get timestamps?
- concept of `rwxrob terminal velocity 10-27`
- linking to zettelkasten generic ideas because i keep having zet-related ideas watching rob
- 28 - bash script in vim to process some lines, why not awk?
  - editing standalone script in new pane in vim
  - panes vs. tabs
- 5:30 book references in markdown in pandoc?
- 6:13 combining README files for KEG nodes
  - bulleted blocks containing nothing but markdown links
  - looks similar to how i was recursively concatenating markdown headings for fzf search content in dotfiles
    - bullet lists as well - i concur with this idea
  - but what if
  - they are
  - a bunch of titles or bullet points
  - on the same line
    - with some nested content
  - they should form a chain
- 7:51 KEG design principles
  - https://github.com/rwxrob/keg/tree/main/docs/spec/2023-01
- 8:53:30 start talking about keg nodes with slide show
- rob has pretty good opinion of gemini, but it still has problems
  - not simple
- 9:00:20 start diagrams about KEG nodes
- "the README web"
- 9:23:28 hyperlinking is a bad idea / broken
  - google page ranking may be partially determined by "being an authority" on something - lack of hyperlinks out?
  - "click here" is a fail
  - original designers of web would not like what it became today
  - removing constraints for developers -> "worst version of adobe flash / html5 you can imagine"
- origin of ideas
  - "guy who created media wiki web"
  - semantic web
- XML was a massive fail
- "mathjax" for math? included in github
- "you need a data.yaml" file for a data node
  - titles from nodes?
- do not want to support yaml tagging, but need to?
- 9:44 reserving elements in yaml schema
- `KEG:` should be reserved in yaml

```
