# identifying type of encryption of unknown ciphertext
the length of ciphertext encrypted with block mode is usually divisible by some power of 2.
if you can roughly guess the size of the input text, you can try all the ciphers until you find one that produces the correct length of output ciphertext.
try oracle padding to brute force one byte at a time for block cipher encrypted cookies
try hash length extension
