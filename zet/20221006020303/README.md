# zettelkasten note types

- cool idea: "inbox" zettel that links to other notes
- bridge notes
  - notes between very different things
  - clarifying slightly different terminology by different authors
- higher level notes (like rwxrob talks about a blog post vs. zettel)
- "proper noun" notes
  - log notes - "daily working log"
  - literature - about something you read
  - people
  - companies

> why not just all nouns in general?
need more graph tools to clean up in order to do something like that.
