# collector fallacy in my note-taking

- concept of `collector fallacy` as it applies to note-taking
- tendency in note-taking to copy paste in snippets that are easy to get anyway, like a help dialog?
- paste in only the relevant parts for specific research or command snippets or tools

```
Finding something interesting isn't the same as knowing something and being able to work with it. I call this the Collector's Fallacy
