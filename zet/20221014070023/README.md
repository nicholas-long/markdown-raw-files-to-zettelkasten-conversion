# findings from implementing deep connectome search

- concept of `findings from implementing deep connectome search`
- printed heading and content
- for links, looped over first ~ 9 links to combine with the rest of the links, for keyword stuffing
- answers that come back are really good
- not full of hidden insights yet, but it seems like a decent research assistant
- power of the deep searching comes from the context of all these keywords together in the right place
- links within the graph drastically improve the results when dealing with keywords

- imagine the power of actually traversing and printing the graph with a graph search algorithm - make a card
  - prioritizing paths by relevance
  - search to certain depth
  - use priorities already in the ordering links in graph
  - prefer results with similar keywords?
