# routing using a linux box enable ip forwarding permanently
edit `/etc/sysctl.conf`
Add one of the following lines to the bottom of the file, depending on whether youâ€™d like Linux IP forwarding to be off or on, respectively. 
Then, save your changes to this file.
The setting will be permanent across reboots.
The net.ipv4.ip_forward setting controls whether IP forwarding is turned on or off for IPv4.
```
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
```
After editing the file, you can run the following command to make the changes take effect right away.
```
# sysctl -p
```
