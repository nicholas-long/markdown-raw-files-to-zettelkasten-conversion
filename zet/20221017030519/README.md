# walk along commit history and elaborate or make connections

- concept of `walk along commit history and elaborate or make connections` - something to do to help organize
  - keep a link in here pointing to the current node in the chain to track progress!
  - update this link to save and track position during project.
  - make multiple passes
    - pass 1 - summary of changes
      - check kb files
        - make sure cards are linked to kb files they came from
      - explore those cards and add links
      - clean up *some* of the empty zettel issues
    - ideas for pass 2
      - video notes in commits that have "start/end of ippxyz video asdfjkl"
        - check day boundaries
        - associate with streamers
        - add boxes to retired boxes and associate with files

- procedure
  - start on first day
  - elaborate
  - make connections
  - tie together files that got moved - link to other card

```
